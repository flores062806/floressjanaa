    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Jana Flores, I'm 17 years old. I'm a Filipino and i was born in Cebu on June 28th in 2006. 
              I was raised by my mother, a single, independent woman, and she greatly inspires me by 
        remaining strong at all times and capable of handling things on my own.  My first name "Jana" means "God is gracious" or "gift
        from god" which is a common name in Slavic, while on the other hand my last name "Flores" means "flowers".
    </p>
    <h3>Who am i in life?</h3>
    <p>I consider myself as a person who is both curious and passionate about life, i tend to focus on finding ways to improve
        myself and ways to have a good lifestyle. Ever since i was young, i've always loved exploring and discovering new things through experiences, or
        conversations with people. One of the things i discovered with myself at a very young age is being able to perform and dance, i started dancing on the age of 4. My mom 
        would take me to dance classes and see me perform on stages and different various of events. I see myself as someone who determined and quite hardworking, 
        with a creative and open mind. I was raised to never judge anyone as i've been friends with different kinds of people yet i always see the good in them, i see
        myself as an understanding person. These qualities have shaped how i approach my studies, relationships, and the way i see the world.
</p>
        
<p> I spend a lot of my free time to my hobbies, which are not just activities for fun but also personal expressions of who I am. I like to watch movies, listen to music, and keep a journal to
     express myself by printing random photos from various moments i've had, playing video games on my phone or computer, and participating in gaming competitions; they allow me to express myself
    and spark my imagination. On days when i need to get my mind off some things, i often dance, go for a walk outdoors with my dog, or just go for a swim. These hobbies balance my life, giving me both
    joy and peace of mind.
</p>

<p> Aside from my personal interests, i deeply value the people around me. My family and friends play a big role in shaping who i am today, i have been always used to being alone or just prefer to be alone but they 
    showed me that i am not always alone that i can always rely on them when things get hard. They are my source of support, inspiration, and motivation. I enjoy spending quality time with them, whether it is through
    simple hang outs, conversations, shared laughter, or helping one another in difficult times. I believe that relationships we build are some of the most important treasures i had in my life.
</p>

<p>
    What truly defines me, however, are my values and aspirations. I believe in kindness, honesty, and perseverance. I always try to look at challenges as opportunities to grow, and i hold on to the idea that every effort, 
    no matter how small, contributes to a bigger purpose. In the future, i hope to use my talents and passions to achieve my goals and, more importantly, to inspire and help others in their own journeys. My interests and values guide
    me toward becoming the best version of myself as i will not stop working hard until i become that kind of person, and i hope to continue carrying these with me as i move forward in life despite how hard i went through i will
    always remain the kind of person who refuses to give up and chase after my dreams and goals and that basically sums up the kind of person i am.
